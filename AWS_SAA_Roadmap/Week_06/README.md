# Week 6: Container & Serverless

## 🎯 Goal
Understand modern application deployment: Containers vs Serverless.

## 📚 Topics

### 1. Containers
- **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: AWS proprietary container orchestration.
- **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Managed Kubernetes.
- **Fargate**: Serverless compute engine for containers (No EC2 management).

### 2. Serverless
- **Lambda**: Run code without provisioning servers.
    - Time limits (15 mins).
    - Event sources.
- **API Gateway**: Create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs.

### 3. Orchestration
- **Step Functions**: Coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows.

## 💡 Key Point
SAA focuses on "Selection Criteria" rather than operational depth. When to use Fargate vs EC2? When to use Lambda?
