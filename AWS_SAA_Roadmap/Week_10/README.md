# Week 10: Final Practice

## 🎯 Goal
Exam readiness.

## 📚 Activities

### 1. Practice Exams
- Take full-length timed mock exams.
- Simulate the exam environment (no distractions).

### 2. Analysis
- **Review every wrong answer**: Understand *why* the correct answer is correct and *why* the distractors are wrong.
- **Review guessed answers**: Even if you got it right, ensure you know the logic.

### 3. Final Polish
- Review "Cheat Sheets" or summary notes.
- Memorize specific limits or numbers if necessary (though SAA is less about numbers now).

## 💡 Key Point
Confidence comes from understanding the concepts, not just memorizing dumps. Good luck!
